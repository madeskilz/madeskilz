## 👋 Hi, I’m Adedoyin Michael

I acquired experience in building Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications for over six years, reporting & analytical tools, and other custom software solutions that are in use by the top Telecommunication Companies in Africa, Government Agencies and Bodies, Agricultural Systems, Educational Systems; including Polytechnics and Universities, and Gaming Organizations to either manage part of their larger workflow or the entire workflow.

My overall technical experience includes Frontend Development., Writing Optimization Algorithms, Backend Developments, REST & PHP/MySQL, React JS, API Integration, Mobile Application Development with React Native, Product Design and Mockups, and creative UI/UX design.

I am passionate about Fullstack Development and am available for Full Stack Roles as this enables me to work both on the Front-end and the Back-end.

Working on both ends exposes me to more knowledge to enhance my career. I can work with startups as I have experience with several Nigerian startups.
